## 2. Notable Price Movements & Possible Causes

Recent news reports indicate that NVDA experienced some shifts during this period. Some key observations include:

- **DeepSeek-Driven Movements:** Bloomberg reported that NVDA shares hovered near a key technical level after a notable drop attributed to a "DeepSeek-driven rout." This suggests that automated or algorithm-driven trading may have caused a sudden sell-off, prompting investors to reexamine technical support levels.

- **Broader Market Impact:** The Wall Street Journal reported a significant drop on or around January 27, 2025, with NVDA contributing to a broad downturn in the Nasdaq Composite and a loss in market value. CNBC also mentioned that NVDA resumed its slide amid a broader market sentiment influenced by the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate cuts.

- **Leadership and Policy Factors:** Investors.com noted that there was some positive sentiment associated with recent high-profile meetings involving NVDA’s CEO, which might have offset some negativity. However, overall, the sentiment appears cautious as investors weighed both technical concerns and macroeconomic policy factors (such as export curbs and Federal Reserve decisions).

## 3. Market Sentiment Overview

The market sentiment around NVDA during this period was mixed:

- **Negative Sentiment:** Several reports (from Bloomberg, WSJ, and CNBC) emphasized the negative impact of the DeepSeek-related fall and broader market weaknesses (e.g., the pause in rate cuts by the Fed) on NVDA's valuation.

- **Cautious Optimism:** Some investors maintained optimism due to strategic actions by NVDA’s management and potential policy shifts, as highlighted by Investors.com.

Taken together, while technical triggers such as the DeepSeek rout have introduced volatility, underlying corporate and macroeconomic factors continue to shape investor confidence in NVDA.
