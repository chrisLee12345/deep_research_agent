## Task: Analyze recent one-month trend of NVDA stock

1. Fetch NVDA stock data for the past one month (from today 2025-02-03 to about 2025-01-03) using yfinance library in a Python script.
2. Visualize NVDA stock price trend with matplotlib and save plot as an image (nvda_trend.png).
3. Identify any sudden/big moves by checking daily percentage change (e.g., threshold >5%).
4. Research possible causes behind these moves and analyze market sentiment via recent news using a search query.
5. Compile all info into a final report markdown file (nvda_analysis_report.md) with analysis insights and embed the generated chart image.

Next Steps:
- Install Python packages: yfinance, matplotlib, pandas.
- Create a Python script (nvda_analysis.py) for data retrieval and visualization.
- Execute the script and capture output.
- Perform web search for NVDA stock sentiment and news.
- Create final report markdown file summarizing findings and embedding visualization.
