## Conclusion
MicroStrategy's recent decisions reflect its ongoing reliance on Bitcoin as a growth driver. While the company has shown resilience in raising capital, its heavy exposure to Bitcoin, rising borrowing costs, and regulatory risks make it a high-risk, high-reward investment. Investors should weigh these risks against potential Bitcoin price trajectories and MicroStrategy's ability to sustain its financial strategies.
